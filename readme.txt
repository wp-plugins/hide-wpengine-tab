== Description ==

WPEngine is a fantastic Wordpress hosting provider with an absolutely fantastic function - the one click staging environment.  This plugin is built to make it super easy to limit access to that button so that people don't accidentally overwrite the staging environment.


== Installation ==

1. Upload 'hide-wpengine-tab' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click on the new menu item "Hide WPEngine Tab" under settings!
4. Add a comma separated list of users that should have access to the tab.  (Note: wpengine gets added automatically.)
